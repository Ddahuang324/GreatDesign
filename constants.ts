    title: "Design Philosophy",
    paragraphs: [
        "Our approach is rooted in a philosophy of subtraction. We believe that true luxury lies not in what is added, but in what is thoughtfully taken away. Each line, material, and source of light is meticulously considered to create spaces that are not just visually stunning, but emotionally resonant.",
        "We blend timeless materials with modern techniques to craft environments that breathe. Natural wood, stone, and expansive glass are our core palette, used to blur the lines between interior and exterior, creating a seamless flow that enhances daily life.",
        "This project was a journey in restraint and refinement. From the foundational structure to the finest details, our goal was to build a home that feels both monumental and intimateâ€”a sanctuary of calm and inspiration."
